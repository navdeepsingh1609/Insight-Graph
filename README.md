<h2>🔍 Key Features:</h2>

📊 Intelligent Data Integration: Easily ingest data from CSV files and transform it into a structured knowledge graph, mapping out relationships between entities.

💡 AI-Powered Insights: Generate automatic, detailed data summaries powered by OpenAI’s models, highlighting key patterns, trends, and feature importance.

🧠 Complex Query Handling: Resolve intricate queries that traditional databases can’t manage, thanks to the power of Neo4j’s graph database.

📈 Real-Time Visualizations: Instantly visualize your data relationships, making complex information easier to explore and understand.

🤖 Interactive Chat: Ask questions and get AI-driven responses based on your knowledge graph for real-time insights.

🔹 Performance Optimization: Leveraging session state, caching key data reduces redundant API calls, resulting in faster performance and smoother user interactions.

🌐 Why Use Knowledge Graphs?
Imagine a system that not only understands your data but also uncovers deeper connections and insights. Knowledge Graphs do just that!
1. 🔗 Rich Context: Capture and visualize relationships between entities for deeper, more accurate insights.
2. 🎯 Precise Results: Reduce ambiguity with clearly defined entities and their connections, improving information retrieval.
3. ⚡ Dynamic & Scalable: Effortlessly add new data and relationships without reworking the entire structure.

Users from any domain—whether business, research, or education—can explore their data in ways traditional databases simply cannot. It’s all about making smarter, faster decisions!
